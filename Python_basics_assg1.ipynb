    "\n",
    "Ans 2: In Python, predefined keywords are reserved words that have special meanings and are used to define the syntax and structure of Python programs. These keywords are part of the language’s grammar, and you cannot use them as variable names or identifiers. They help perform various functions. Some keywords are: for, while, if, def, else etc\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Python keywords:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. if, else, elif: Used for conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "# code \n",
    "x = 10\n",

    "# Ques 3: Compare and contrast mutable and immutable objects in Python with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 3: In Python, objects can be classified as mutable or immutable based on whether their values can be changed after they are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable Objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mutable objects can be changed after creation, meaning their internal state can be modified.\n",
    "2. Common mutable objects include lists, dictionaries, and sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "# code\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_list[0] = 10  # Modifying the first element\n",
    "print(my_list) # Output: [10, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable Objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Immutable objects cannot be changed after they are created. Any operation that tries to modify them will result in the creation of a new object.\n",
    "2. Common immutable objects include tuples, strings, and integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "# code\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "# Trying to modify an element in the tuple will raise an error\n",
    "# my_tuple[0] = 10  # This will cause a TypeError because tuples are immutable\n",

    "print(my_new_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "1. Modification: Mutable objects can be directly modified, while immutable objects cannot.\n",
    "2. Efficiency: Immutable objects are generally more memory-efficient because they prevent unwanted changes.\n",
    "3. Examples: Lists and dictionaries are mutable, while strings and tuples are immutable.\n"

    "# Ques 6: How do conditional statements work in Python? Illustrate with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 6: Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute specific blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false. The main conditional statements are if, elif, and else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Conditional Statements:\n",
    "1. if: Executes a block of code if the condition is true.\n",
    "2. elif: (else if) Checks another condition if the previous if was false.\n",
    "3. else: Executes if all previous conditions are false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "# code\n",

    "# if statement\n",

    "\n",
    "# if-elif-else statement\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans 7: Python provides two primary types of loops: for loops and while loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. for Loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a block of code for each element.\n",
